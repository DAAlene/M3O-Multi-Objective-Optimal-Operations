### M3O-Multi-Objective-Optimal-Operations
M3O is a Matlab toolbox for designing the optimal operations of multipurpose water reservoir systems. M3O allows users to design Pareto optimal (or approximate) operating policies for managing water reservoir systems through several alternative state-of-the-art methods. Version 1.0 of M3O includes Deterministic and Stochastic Dynamic Programming, Implicit Stochastic Optimization, Sampling Stochastic Dynamic Programming, fitted Q-iteration, Evolutionary Multi-Objective Direct Policy Search, and Model Predictive Control. The toolbox is designed to be accessible to practitioners, researchers, and students, and to provide a fully commented and customizable code for more experienced users.
